## Introduction

The Python script is designed to detect and draw lane lines in video footage using OpenCV (Open Source Computer vision) library. Lane line detection is a crtitical component in various computer vision application, such as self-driving cars. The script processes video frames to identify and highlight lane markings, making it a valuable tool in the field of computer vision.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python**: The script is written in python and requires a python environment.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: OpenCv must be installed to perform various image processing tasks and lane detection.
- **MoviePy**: MoviePy is used for video editing and processing, so make sure it's installed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or create a new python script.
2.
